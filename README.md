# Introduction
This is a DPS/HPS meter for City of Heroes: Homecoming

It's still highly in development, and utterly without any GUI as I'm using this as a way to teach myself python.
GUI may come in the future.

## Useage
Parse.py is the main program, it now has a basic UI via Gradio

>python parse.py

It will then open a page at 127.0.0.1:7860
The box over the Parse button uses your file location (without ").
then just hit parse.
